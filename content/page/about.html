<p>
  The Ethereum Security Consortium (ESC) is a decentralized autonomous consortium where
  <a href="/participate#membership">membership organizations</a>, part-time staff, and the public work together to
  develop <a href="/standards">operational security standards</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The consortium was founded by <a href="https://twitter.com/dickolsson">Dick Olsson</a> in July 2017 when submitting
  the first standard proposal as part of <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/679">EIP-679</a>.

  <dt>What is "OPSEC"?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      OPSEC is an abbreviation for Operational Security â€” the process that identifies critical information or processes
      that need protection. In the context of Ethereum this includes operational procedures around writing secure
      software, such as reponsible disclosure, physical device management, <abbr title="Local Area Network">LAN</abbr>
      or <abbr title="Wide Area Network">WAN</abbr> security etc.

  <dt>How is ESC different to the <a href="https://ethereum.org/foundation">Ethereum Foundation</a>?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      While the Ethereum Foundation is focusing on base layer research and development for the Ethereum platform their
      neutrality is important. But secure operational practices require close collaboration between organizations to
      ensure a responsive and consistent ecosystem in this regard. The ESC exists to close that gap.

    <dt>How is ESC different to <a href="https://openzeppelin.org/">OpenZeppelin</a> or
    <a href="https://media.consensys.net/@c.diligence">Consensys Diligence</a>?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      ESC does not create Ethereum software or audit smart contracts. ESC is focusing on operational security practices.
