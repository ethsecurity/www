      The goal is to produce standards that compliment, and where relevant replace, existing industry standards such as
      ISO 27001:2013.
    </p>
    <p>
      ESC standards are being governed by a process called <em>Ethereum Opsec Proposals</em> (EOPs) and managed in the
      <a href="https://github.com/ethsecurity/EOPs">EOP Github repository</a>. The process is defined by
      <a href="https://github.com/ethsecurity/EOPs/blob/master/EOPs/eop-1.md">EOP-1</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      All standards should first be considered as an Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) and only proposals that are out
      of scope for EIP should be submitted as EOP.
    </p>
    <p>Below is a brief summary of relevant EIPs and EOPs with respective status.</p>

    <h2>EIP-679</h2>

Title: Ethereum Vulnerability Reporting Framework
Type: Informational

Created: 2017-07-21</pre>
    <p>
      The goal of this framework, and the reason for standardization, is to offer users a consistent and reliable
      disclosure process that will improve responsiveness, information accuracy and ultimately security of the ecosystem
      as a whole.

Title: Ethereum Vulnerability Scoring System
Type: Informational

Created: 2017-08-06</pre>
    <p>
      The scope of this standard is to come with an alternative to the
      <a href="https://www.first.org/cvss/">Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)</a> that is adapted to Ethereum
      and the use case around smart contract etc.
