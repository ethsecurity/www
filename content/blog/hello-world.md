Hello world, please let us introduce ourselves. We're the Ethereum Security Consortium, here to drive standards around
operational security for the Ethereum ecosystem.

We are still at the very beginning of setting up the consortium but will keep everyone up-to-date via this website,
[our Github organization](https://github.com/ethsecurity) and [our Twitter account](https://twitter.com/ethsecurity).
