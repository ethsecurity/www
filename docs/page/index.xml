      <description>The goal is to produce standards that compliment, and where relevant replace, existing industry standards such as ISO 27001:2013.  ESC standards are being governed by a process called Ethereum Opsec Proposals (EOPs) and managed in the EOP Github repository. The process is defined by EOP-1.  All standards should first be considered as an Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) and only proposals that are out of scope for EIP should be submitted as EOP.</description>
